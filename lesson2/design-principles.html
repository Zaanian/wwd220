        <p>
          ChurchofJesusChrist.org has a very clean look to it. There is proper
          spacing so that there is a lot of content but it does not feel
          cluttered or disorganized, nor do I feel overwhelmed when looking
          through the content.

        <p>Company: Games Workshop</p>
        <p>
          games-workshop.com is a sight to order gaming models. The website
          applys Hick's law by using images, filters, and stylized logo's. it
          easier to select what you want with filters to sort the products and
          every product has an image that shows you exactly what you will be
          getting.

        <p>Company: Games Workshop</p>
        <p>
          Forgeworld follows the Rule of Thirds principle with all of it's
          images. It is a site that sells models and the best way to do that is
          to show the model.
